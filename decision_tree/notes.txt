This model really needs more data.
For instance, 0,0,0,0 should, by all accounts be bad weather, but it has confidently called it good at 100%.

This is far too overfitting, and the data is far too small.
Also, the good vs bad weather actual value is far too subjective.

This is just for exemplifying a decision tree model.
