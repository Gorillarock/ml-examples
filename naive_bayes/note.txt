This is just an example.  Naive Bayes does not work great with such a small list of token words.
For instance, "I need you to pick up the kids tomorrow" predicts spam at over 99%.

This could be improved by:
- a recursive model
- a larger data set
- removal of certain tokens from computation (such as 'and', 'a', 'or')
